= Testing the model API

Now that you've deployed the model, you can test its API endpoints.


.Procedure

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to the project details page and click the *Models* tab. 

. Take note of the model's Inference endpoint URL. You need this information when you test the model API.

+
If the *Inference endpoint* field contains an *Internal Service* link, click the link to open a text box that shows the URL.

. Return to the Jupyter environment and try out your new endpoint.
+
If you deployed your model with multi-model serving, follow the directions in `3_rest_requests_multi_model.ipynb` to try a REST API call and `4_grpc_requests_multi_model.ipynb` to try a gRPC API call.
+
If you deployed your model with single-model serving, follow the directions in `5_rest_requests_single_model.ipynb` to try a REST API call.
