= Creating a workbench and selecting a notebook image

A workbench is an instance of your development and experimentation environment. Within a workbench you can select a notebook image for your data science work.

.Prerequisites

* You created a `My Storage` data connection as described in xref:storing-data-with-data-connections.adoc[Storing data with data connections].

* You configured a pipeline server as described in xref:enabling-data-science-pipelines.adoc[Enabling data science pipelines].


.Procedure

. Navigate to the project detail page for the data science project that you created in xref:setting-up-your-data-science-project.adoc[Setting up your data science project].

. Click the *Workbenches* tab, and then click the *Create workbench* button.
